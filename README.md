Here I learn stm32.

`cmsis` folder contains code that do not use SPL or HAL. 
There is only my code (and CMSIS), that I wrote with datasheets and 
with a glance at SPL's code. Also, there is `my_utility.h` that contains
useful (for me) functions. A goal of this folder to use only CMSIS, datasheet
and registers. 

`spl` folder contains code that use SPL. Here I learn to use SPL and how to use it.

`notes.md` contains algorighms to how use periphery.
